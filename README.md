The Secret Cocktail Webapp is an automated phone survey system to help nursing trainees find facilities near them to complete
their required training hours. Our software features a phone survey system that sends questionnaires to facilities and
based on their responses, they can be added to our database of facilities hosting nursing training. We also have a web
application that allows nursing trainees to easily find nearby facilities where they can complete their required
training hours.

<!-- Installation Guide -->

## Installation Guide

### Required Software

- [NodeJs 16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

### Run in Development Mode

First, dependencies must be installed.

To install dependencies for the web app run the following command in the root of the project:

```shell
# install dependencies for web app
yarn
```

To install dependencies for the server (Firebase functions) run the following command in the ``functions`` folder:

```shell
# install dependencies for Firebase functions (ensure NodeJS 16 is installed)
yarn
```

To run the web app available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), run the following command in the root of the project:

```shell
yarn start
```

To run the server (Firebase functions), run the following command in the ``functions`` folder:

```shell
yarn start
```

**Required Environment Variables for the Server**

These are environment variables that must be defined for the server to run properly. Create a ``.env`` file with the following content in the ``functions`` folder:

```shell
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="..."
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="..."
TWILIO_STATUS_CALLBACK_URL="https://something.com"
EMAIL_EMAIL="someone@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="..."
```

``EMAIL_EMAIL`` and ``EMAIL_PASSWORD`` are the email and password for the account that will send authentication information emails to new facilities. If you are using a Gmail account, an [App Password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) must be used instead of the actual Gmail account password. 

``TWILIO_STATUS_CALLBACK_URL`` is the URL Twilio will make requests to in order to progress the phone survey. This can be set to the production URL ``"https://us-central1-secret-cocktail.cloudfunctions.net/app"``.

``TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`` and ``TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`` can be found in the Twilio dashboard.

``TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`` is the registered phone number associated with the Twilio account that will make phone calls to facilities. 

### Deploy the Software

After ensuring the software can run on your machine, you may deploy it now.

To deploy the web app run the following command in the root of the project:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

To deploy the server (Firebase functions) run the following command in the ``functions`` folder:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

Please ensure that the ``.env`` file with the required server environment variables are defined.
